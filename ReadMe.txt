Microsoft Visual Studio Connection Dialog
=========================================
This is the Visual Studio connection dialog originally released by Microsoft but no longer available on their website.

Details of the dialog are outlined in this msdn blog entry:

The original project site can also be viewed via the Internet Archive's Way Back Machine:

If all you need is the prebuilt dialog then use nuget:
