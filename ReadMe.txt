Microsoft Visual Studio Connection Dialog
=========================================
This is the Visual Studio connection dialog originally released by Microsoft but no longer available on their website.

Details of the dialog are outlined in this msdn blog entry:

The original project site can also be viewed via the Internet Archive's Way Back Machine:

If all you need is the prebuilt dialog then use nuget:
https://www.nuget.org/packages/DataConnectionDialog/

This source is also available in the "Tools" directory of the nuget package. The project files of the source here have been updated so that they may be built in Visual Studio 2013.
